            <p>
                To successfully change your vehicle's oil, gather these essential tools: a socket set with a ratchet and various sockets, gloves to protect your hands from oil, paper towels for cleanup, new oil and an oil filter, an oil filter wrench (optional but recommended), an oil catch pan, a funnel, a breaker bar, and a jack to lift your vehicle.

                Step 1: Determine the Correct Oil for Your Vehicle
            </h2>

            <p>
                To find the correct oil for your vehicle, consult the owner's manual for specific recommendations. If the manual is unavailable, many auto parts stores offer reference guides that list the appropriate oil types for various vehicle makes and models.

            <p>
                To access the oil pan, you'll need to lift your vehicle. Refer to your owner's manual for instructions on using a jack safely. Make sure to block the rear wheels to prevent rolling. For automatic transmissions, ensure the vehicle is in park and engage the parking brake for added security.

                Step 3: Locate the Oil Drain Plug

            <img src="oil-drain-plug-under-vehicle.jpg" alt="Close-up of the oil drain plug on the vehicle's oil pan." />
            <p>
                Locate the oil drain plug on the underside of the oil pan. It is typically a black bolt. There may be a separate pan for the transmission, which does not have a drain plug. The oil filter is usually located near the drain plug or on top of the engine, depending on your vehicle's design.

            <img src="oil-pan-draining-vehicle-oil.jpg" alt="Close-up of the oil pan with the drain plug removed." />
            <p>
                Before removing the drain plug, position your oil catch pan underneath to collect the old oil. Use a ratchet to remove the drain plug, and if needed, use a breaker bar for added leverage. Allow the oil to drain completely into the pan.

            <img src="removing-oil-filter-vehicle-oil-change.jpg" alt="Close-up of the oil filter on the vehicle." />
            <p>
                Next, remove the oil filter. If it is difficult to remove, use an oil filter wrench or an adjustable tool to help loosen it. Once removed, install the new oil filter by hand, ensuring it is snug but not over-tightened.

            <img src="adding-new-oil-to-vehicle.jpg" alt="Close-up of the oil filler cap on the vehicle's engine." />
            <p>
                After replacing the filter, add new oil through the oil filler cap, which is usually marked with an oil icon. Make sure the cap is clean to avoid contaminating the new oil. Once you've added the correct amount of oil, start the engine and check for any leaks. Turn off the engine and check the oil level with the dipstick, adding more oil if necessary.
